If you like learning about traders and trading, you'll find that reading this book is time well spent.\" -Richard Dennis, President, The Dennis Trading Group, Inc. \"Jack Schwager's deep knowledge of the markets and his extensive network of personal contacts throughout the industry have set him apart as the definitive market chronicler of our age.\" -Ed Seykota \"Very interesting indeed!\" -John Train, author of The Money Masters \"Successful trading demands longtime experience because it requires firsthand knowledge. If there is a shortcut to this requirement, however, it is in reading about the experiences of others. Jack Schwager's book provides that shortcut. If you find yourself sweating upon occasion as you read, then you're as close to the trading experience as you can get without actually doing it yourself.\" -Robert R. Prechter, Jr., editor, The Elliott Wave Theorist THE NEW MARKET WIZARDS Some traders distinguish themselves from the herd. These supertraders make millions of dollars-sometimes in hours-and consistently outperform their peers. As he did in his acclaimed national bestseller, Market Wizards, Jack Schwager interviews a host of these supertraders, spectacular winners whose success occurs across a spectrum of financial markets. These traders use different methods, but they all share an edge. How do they do it? What separates them from the others? What can they teach the average trader or investor? In The New Market Wizards, these wildly successful traders relate the financial strategies that have rocketed them to success, as well as the embarrassing losses that have proven them all too human. Meet the Wizards of Wall Street: * Stan Druckenmiller, who, as manager of the Soros Quantum Fund, realized an average annual return of more than 38 percent on assets ranging between $2.0 and $3.5 billion * William Eckhardt, a mathematician who, in collaboration with trader Richard Dennis, selected and trained the now-legendary circle known as the Turtles * Bill Lipschutz, a former architect who, for eight years, was Salomon Brothers' largest and most successful currency trader * Blair Hull, a one-time blackjack player who began an options trading company with Asking the questions that readers with an interest in the financial markets would love to pose to the financial superstars, and filled with candid appraisals, The New Market Wizards takes its place as a classic.",

As Napoleon\u2019s army invades, Tolstoy vividly follows characters from diverse backgrounds\u2014peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers\u2014as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving\u2014and human\u2014figures in world literature. Pevear and Volokhonsky have brought us this classic novel in a translation remarkable for its fidelity to Tolstoy\u2019s style and cadence and for its energetic, accessible prose.",

Women have it, men need it. Both can dramatically improve their investment returns\u2014with much less work and worry\u2014simply by reading this witty, well-researched road map.\" \u2014Daniel H. Pink, author of Drive and A Whole New Mind Investing isn't a man's world anymore\u2014and that's a good thing for individual portfolios, Wall Street, and the world's financial system. Warren Buffett and the women of the world have one thing in common: they are better investors than the average man. Psychologists and scientists have shown that women have the kind of temperaments that help them achieve long-term success in the market. For instance, women spend more time researching their investment choices and tend to take less risks than men do, which prevents them from chasing \"hot\" tips and trading on whims. And women aren't as susceptible to peer pressure as men are, which results in a more levelheaded, patient approach to investing. This book shows that women, with their patience and good decision making, epitomize the Foolish temperament of the most successful investor in the world. It will empower and educate women\u2014and the men smart enough to embrace a \"feminine\" investing style\u2014on how to strengthen their portfolios and find success in the market. \"Entertaining. . . . The idea of using Mr. Buffett as the symbol for her investing approach is effective.\" \u2014 New York Times \"A refreshingly new approach to understanding Buffett. . . . LouAnn Lofton convincingly argues that both men and women can improve their stock returns by studying how women (and Buffett) have been more successful in investing.\" \u2014Prem C.

    "description": "Trading stocks, currencies, futures, and other financial contracts is not actually complicated and anybody can learn it in a relatively short time. This has been my daily experience for the past decade and even traders who have tried everything for years without success can make their first profits if the art of trading is explained to them in the right way. However, the keyword \"in the right way\" is important here. This book focuses on technical analysis, explanation and interpretation of price movements and chart patterns as well as on learning effective, ready-to-use trading strategies. However, it is important to go beyond the usual technical analysis, and to analyze the behavior of traders based on psychological factors and phenomena of mass psychology as well. The price movements on the international financial markets arise because millions of people interact with each other every day. Buying and selling decisions are influenced by emotions and human behavioral patterns.Whether we are looking at a speculator from China 200 years ago, a Wall Street pit trader from New York 80 years ago or a modern-day \"Joe Bloggs trader,\" trading from his/her smartphone - the human components, i.e. emotions and instincts, hardly differ. Greed, fear, uncertainty and the willingness to take risks have determined human actions for millennia and, of course, also how people have maneuvered their money around the world's markets for centuries. Those who learn to read the buyer and seller interaction from the charts will be able to read and handle any price movement. This is true because all price charts follow universal and timeless rules that can be successfully interpreted with the help of effective technical analysis.Over the years, more than one million visitors have already searched for information about trading on our website www.tradeciety.com. Every day, traders ask us how they can understand technical analysis and trading in a better manner. This book is a result of the motivation to answer these questions collectively. It is the book I would have wished for at the beginning of my trading career over 15 years ago.The first section of this book provides comprehensive knowledge of the fundamentals and individual components of technical analysis and price analysis. The second section focuses on the most important trading patterns as well as the correct interpretation of chart formations. We will explore potential entry signal points and trading strategies so that traders can now already make sense of their own charts with confidence. The third and final section focuses on developing a customized trading strategy. In addition to an insight into important psychological trading concepts, traders will get numerous practical tips to ensure that they handle their trading professionally at the end of this book. The goal of this book is it to enable the reader to look behind the price movements and understand why prices rise and fall, how buyers and sellers interact and thus to make effective trading decisions. The comprehensive and step-by-step knowledge of technical analysis ultimately makes it possible to interpret any chart situation and, thus, hopefully, become an independent trader.",

    "description": "The best-selling investing \"bible\" offers new information, new insights, and new perspectives The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is the classic guide to getting smart about the market. Legendary mutual fund pioneer John C. Bogle reveals his key to getting more out of investing: low-cost index funds. Bogle describes the simplest and most effective investment strategy for building wealth over the long term: buy and hold, at very low cost, a mutual fund that tracks a broad stock market Index such as the S&P 500. While the stock market has tumbled and then soared since the first edition of Little Book of Common Sense was published in April 2007, Bogle\u2019s investment principles have endured and served investors well. This tenth anniversary edition includes updated data and new information but maintains the same long-term perspective as in its predecessor. Bogle has also added two new chapters designed to provide further guidance to investors: one on asset allocation, the other on retirement investing. A portfolio focused on index funds is the only investment that effectively guarantees your fair share of stock market returns. This strategy is favored by Warren Buffett, who said this about Bogle: \u201cIf a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle. For decades, Jack has urged investors to invest in ultra-low-cost index funds. . . . Today, however, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he helped millions of investors realize far better returns on their savings than they otherwise would have earned. He is a hero to them and to me.\u201d Bogle shows you how to make index investing work for you and help you achieve your financial goals, and finds support from some of the world's best financial minds: not only Warren Buffett, but Benjamin Graham, Paul Samuelson, Burton Malkiel, Yale\u2019s David Swensen, Cliff Asness of AQR, and many others. This new edition of The Little Book of Common Sense Investing offers you the same solid strategy as its predecessor for building your financial future. Build a broadly diversified, low-cost portfolio without the risks of individual stocks, manager selection, or sector rotation. Forget the fads and marketing hype, and focus on what works in the real world. Understand that stock returns are generated by three sources (dividend yield, earnings growth, and change in market valuation) in order to establish rational expectations for stock returns over the coming decade. Recognize that in the long run, business reality trumps market expectations. Learn how to harness the magic of compounding returns while avoiding the tyranny of compounding costs. While index investing allows you to sit back and let the market do the work for you, too many investors trade frantically, turning a winner\u2019s game into a loser\u2019s game. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is a solid guidebook to your financial future.",

    "description": "Point and Figure charts are one of the great secrets of the Technical Analysis world. Highly sophisticated and with a thoroughbred pedigree, they can, however, be overlooked by traders today. Jeremy du Plessis - one of the foremost Point and Figure experts in the world - returns with a fully updated second edition of this definitive guide in an effort to redress this imbalance. This second edition, with an extensive revision to the text and introduction of brand new techniques, demystifies the world of Point and Figure charting. It includes a detailed explanation of the history and development of the technique from its invention to the modern day, and covers the makeup of the chart patterns, why they are created, and how to interpret them. Throughout, readers are encouraged to understand Point and Figure charts from first principles, rather than just remember the names of a series of patterns. It is the first major work for 50 years to discuss in depth the original 1-box reversal method of Point and Figure charting and contrast it with the more popular 3-box reversal method. Further, the explanation of how to use Point and Figure charts to project targets and calculate risk-reward ratios is the most comprehensive ever seen. Also featured in the second edition are: - A step-by-step analysis of the FTSE 100 Index using the 3-box method, as well as the NASDAQ Composite Index, using the 1-box method - A detailed discussion of optimising techniques - An in-depth chapter on Analysing Point and Figure charts, extensively rewritten from the first edition - A new explanation of how Point and Figure parameters are chosen and the implications of choosing them - Two new Point and Figure construction methods never seen before - Point and Figure's contribution to market breadth, with a look at bullish percent and two brand new indicators - Full discussion of Point and Figure gaps and how they provide valuable information about the chart - Lesser known, more advanced techniques such as the use of moving averages, parabolic SAR and Bollinger Bands on Point and Figure charts - Price and volume activity histograms and how they provide information about support and resistance All this is illustrated with numerous colour charts and observations from years of trading experience. According to du Plessis, Point and Figure charts are the 'voice of the market'. This book helps you listen to, and understand, that voice.

'Gorgeously written, humorous, compelling, life affirming' Justin Webb, Mail on Sunday In the first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama recounts his journey from a young man searching for his identity to the 44th president of the United States, describing in strikingly personal detail his political education and landmark moments of his first term. Reflecting on his presidency, Obama takes readers from his early political dreams to his Iowa caucus victory and the historic night of November 4, 2008, when he became the first African American president. It is the story of one man\u2019s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad and bearing the expectation of a generation buoyed by messages of \u201chope and change\u201d, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama\u2019s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high, but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day",

He who knows it not, knows not the heights and depths of the soul; he misses the trials and tragedy and the beauty and grandeur of life. The Mahabharata is not a mere epic; it is a romance, telling the tale of heroic men and women, and of some who were divine; it is a whole literature in itself, containing a code of life, a philosophy of social and ethical relations, and speculative thought on human problems that is hard to rival; but, above all, it has for its core the Gita,which is, as the world is beginning to find out, the noblest of scriptures and the grandest of sagas in which the climax is reached in the wondrous apocalypse in the Eleventh Canto.",

This is a manifesto for how to operate in the twenty-first century, where everything has been turned on its head. Building on the runaway success of Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power (almost five million copies sold), the 'modern Machiavelli' teams up with rapper 50 Cent to show how the power game of success can be played to your advantage. Drawing on the lore of gangsters, hustlers, and hip-hop artists, as well as 50 Cent's business and artistic dealings, the authors present the 'Laws of 50', revealing how to become a master strategist and supreme realist. Success comes from seeking an advantage in each and every encounter, and The 50th Law offers indispensable advice on how to win in business - and in life.",

The book begins by discussing the operation of the financial industry and the business models of different types of Wall Street firms, as well as the job roles those with technical backgrounds can fill in those firms. Then it describes the mechanics of how these firms make money trading the main financial markets (focusing on fixed income, but also covering equity, options and derivatives markets), and highlights the ways in which quantitative professionals can participate in this money-making process. The second half focuses on the main areas of Wall Street technology and explains how financial models and systems are created, implemented, and used in real life. This is one of the few books that offers a review of relevant literature and Internet resources.",

To answer this question, we must look into our evolutionary past, argues prominent psychologist David M. Buss. Based one of the largest studies of human mating ever undertaken, encompassing more than 10,000 people of all ages from thirty-seven cultures worldwide, The Evolution of Desire is the first work to present a unified theory of human mating behavior. Drawing on a wide range of examples of mating behavior \u2014 from lovebugs to elephant seals, from the Yanomam\u00f6 tribe of Venezuela to online dating apps \u2014 Buss reveals what women want, what men want, and why their desires radically differ. Love has a central place in human sexual psychology, but conflict, competition, and manipulation also pervade human mating \u2014 something we must confront in order to control our own mating destiny. Updated to reflect the very latest scientific research on human mating, this definitive edition of this classic work of evolutionary psychology explains the powerful forces that shape our most intimate desires.",

Now, two years after her son's horrific rampage, Eva comes to terms with her role as Kevin's mother in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her absent husband Franklyn about their son's upbringing. Fearing that her own shortcomings may have shaped what her son has become, she confesses to a deep, long-standing ambivalence about motherhood. How much is her fault? In Lionel Shriver's hands this sensational, chilling and memorable story of a woman who raised a monster becomes a metaphor for the larger tragedy - the tragedy of a country where everything works, nobody starves, and anything can be bought but a sense of purpose.",

    "description": "From the acclaimed bestselling author and self-help legend 'She's so good, Bren\u00e9 Brown, at finding the language to articulate collective feeling' Dolly Alderton 'A wonderful book: urgent, essential and fun to read. I couldn't put it down, and it continues to resonate with me' - Seth Godin Every time we are faced with change, no matter how great or small, we also face risk. We feel uncertain and exposed. We feel vulnerable. Most of us try to fight those feelings - or feel guilt for feeling them in the first place. In a powerful new vision Dr Bren\u00e9 Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability, and dispels the widely accepted myth that it's a weakness. She argues that, in truth, vulnerability is strength and when we shut ourselves off from vulnerability - from revealing our true selves - we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Daring Greatly is the culmination of 12 years of groundbreaking social research, across every area of our lives including home, relationships, work, and parenting. It is an invitation to be courageous; to show up and let ourselves be seen, even when there are no guarantees. This is vulnerability. This is daring greatly.",

    "description": "The inspirational sequel to 12 RULES FOR LIFE, which has sold over 10 million copies around the world - now in paperback In 12 Rules for Life, acclaimed public thinker and clinical psychologist Jordan B. Peterson offered an antidote to the chaos in our lives: eternal truths applied to modern anxieties. His insights have helped millions of readers and resonated powerfully around the world. Now in this long-awaited sequel, Peterson goes further, showing that part of life's meaning comes from reaching out into the domain beyond what we know, and adapting to an ever-transforming world. While an excess of chaos threatens us with uncertainty, an excess of order leads to a lack of curiosity and creative vitality. Beyond Order therefore calls on us to balance the two fundamental principles of reality - order and chaos - and reveals the profound meaning that can be found on the path that divides them. In times of instability and suffering, Peterson reminds us that there are sources of strength on which we can all draw: insights borrowed from psychology, philosophy, and humanity's greatest myths and stories. Drawing on the hard-won truths of ancient wisdom, as well as deeply personal lessons from his own life and clinical practice, Peterson offers twelve new principles to guide readers towards a more courageous, truthful and meaningful life.",

    "description": "From the Academy Award\u00ae-winning actor, an unconventional memoir filled with raucous stories, outlaw wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living with greater satisfaction. I've been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life's challenges - how to get relative with the inevitable - you can enjoy a state of success I call 'catching greenlights.' So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it's medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot's license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It's a love letter. To life. It's also a guide to catching more greenlights-and to realising that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Good luck.",

    "description": "What happens when a young Wall Street investment banker spends a small fortune to have lunch with Warren Buffett? He becomes a real value investor. In this fascinating inside story, Guy Spier details his career from Harvard MBA to hedge fund manager. But the path was not so straightforward. Spier reveals his transformation from a Gordon Gekko wannabe, driven by greed, to a sophisticated investor who enjoys success without selling his soul to the highest bidder. Spier's journey is similar to the thousands that flock to Wall Street every year with their shiny new diplomas, aiming to be King of Wall Street. Yet what Guy realized just in the nick of time was that the King really lived 1,500 miles away in Omaha, Nebraska. Spier determinedly set out to create a new career in his own way. Along the way he learned some powerful lessons which include: > why the right mentors and partners are critical to long term success on Wall Street; > why a topnotch education can sometimes get in the way of your success; > that real learning doesn't begin until you are on your own; > and how the best lessons from Warren Buffett have less to do with investing and more to do with being true to yourself. Spier also reveals some of his own winning investment strategies, detailing deals that were winners but also what he learned from deals that went south. Part memoir, part Wall Street advice, and part how-to, Guy Spier takes readers on a ride through Wall Street--but, more importantly, provides those that want to take a different path with the insight, guidance, and inspiration they need to carve out their own definition of success.",

    "description": "Summary PostGIS in Action, Second Edition teaches readers of all levels to write spatial queries that solve real-world problems. It first gives you a background in vector-, raster-, and topology-based GIS and then quickly moves into analyzing, viewing, and mapping data. This second edition covers PostGIS 2.0 and 2.1 series, PostgreSQL 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 features, and shows you how to integrate with other GIS tools. Foreword by Paul Ramsey. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Book Processing data tied to location and topology requires specialized know-how. PostGIS is a free spatial database extender for PostgreSQL, every bit as good as proprietary software. With it, you can easily create location-aware queries in just a few lines of SQL code and build the back end for a mapping, raster analysis, or routing application with minimal effort. PostGIS in Action, Second Edition teaches you to solve real-world geodata problems. It first gives you a background in vector-, raster-, and topology-based GIS and then quickly moves into analyzing, viewing, and mapping data. You'll learn how to optimize queries for maximum speed, simplify geometries for greater efficiency, and create custom functions for your own applications. You'll also learn how to apply your existing GIS knowledge to PostGIS and integrate with other GIS tools. Familiarity with relational database and GIS concepts is helpful but not required. What's Inside An introduction to spatial databases Geometry, geography, raster, and topology spatial types, functions, and queries Applying PostGIS to real-world problems Extending PostGIS to web and desktop applications Updated for PostGIS 2.x and PostgreSQL 9.x About the Authors Regina Obe and Leo Hsu are database consultants and authors.

In addition, he offers his most subtle, detailed and sophisticated account of the virtues, ideas, and practices which will characterize philosophy and philosophers of the future. With his relentlessly energetic style and tirelessly probing manner, Nietzsche embodies the type of thought he wants to foster, while defining its historical role and determining its agenda.

In The Laws of Human Nature, Greene takes a look at 18 laws that reveal who we are and why we do the things we do. Humans are complex beings, but Greene uses these laws to strip human nature down to its bare bones. Every law that he presents is supported by a real-life historical account, with an insightful twist to drive the point home. As you read the book, don\u2019t be surprised if you get the feeling that everyone you know, including yourself, is described in the book!

It is applicable whenever two individuals-or companies, or political parties, or nations-confront situations where the outcome for each depends on the behavior of all. What are the best strategies in such situations? If there are chances of cooperation, with whom should you cooperate, and how should you share the proceeds of cooperation? Since its creation by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944, game theory has shed new light on business, politics, economics, social psychology, philosophy, and evolutionary biology. In this book, its fundamental ideas are developed with mathematics at the level of high school algebra and applied to many of these fields (see the table of contents). Ideas like ``fairness'' are presented via axioms that fair allocations should satisfy; thus the reader is introduced to axiomatic thinking as well as to mathematical modeling of actual situations.",

    "description": "The competing pressures of our daily lives often leave us little time to read, but by applying this life hack, you can improve your reading speed in under 10 days! Written for everyone who doesn\u2019t have the time to read as much as they\u2019d like or for those whose to-be-read pile has taken over their apartment, 10 Days to Faster Reading outlines why our inability to read quickly isn\u2019t formed through overcommitment. Positing that bad habits and toxic mindsets prevent us reading effectively, the joint research of The Princeton Language Institute and author Abby Marks Beale offers practical solutions for tackling those setbacks and developing efficient reading habits.

    "description": "The Perfect Remedy for Cold Feet! More than half of all couples who become engaged this year will never make it to the altar. Why? Leading experts believe it's because couples fail to really get to know their potential mate before getting engaged. Relationship expert and noted couples counselor Norm Wright steers potential brides and grooms through a series of soul-searching questions to discern if they've really met \"the One.\" Couples will be much more confident about whether or not to pursue marriage after completing these in-depth and personal questions. Norm also addresses the delicate subject of calling off the wedding if readers discover that a potential mate isn't actually meant to be a life partner."

    "description": "I took home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's, IKEA, Ford, Motorola, and Yahoo combined as a kid in my 20s using the $100M Offers method. It works. And it will work for you. Not that long ago, though, my business had gotten so bad that I literally couldn\u2019t even give my services away for free. At the end of each month, I would look at my bank account hoping to see progress (but there wasn\u2019t). I knew something had to change...but what? Over the next 48 months, I went from losing money to making $36 for every $1 spent. In that time period, we generated over $120,000,000 across four different industries: service, ecommerce, software, and brick and mortar. But, unlike everyone else, we didn\u2019t have great funnels, great ads, or a wealthy niche. In fact, we didn\u2019t even send emails until we had crossed $50M in sales. Instead, we were able to do this one thing really well: We created offers so good, people felt stupid saying no. Here\u2019s exactly what this book will show you how to do: How to charge a lot more than you currently are The tiny market, big money process we use to laser focus on niche markets overflowing with cash The \u201cunfair\u201d pricing formula: How we multiplied our pricing by 100 (and got more people to say yes...for real) The value flip...so you never get price compared again (That\u2019s a promise.) The virtuous cycle of price: Use it to outspend your competition (for good) while using your product to attract the best talent. How to make your product so good, prospects find a way to pay for it The unbeatable value equation: to make what you sell worth more than your prospects have ever received The delivery cube: to make delivering your products and services cost less but provide more The trim and stack hack: to maximize profit using the absolute best delivery methods. (This has never been shared publicly and was how we made $17m in profit on $28m in revenue in a year when I was 28 years old) How to enhance your offer so much, prospects buy without hesitating The scarcity stack: How to use the three different types of scarcity in every offer you make (without lying) to get people to buy the moment you ask The \u201ceveryday\u201d urgency blueprint: to get prospects to buy right now, using everyday life to create real, ethical time pressure Unbeatable bonuses...and watch your prospects' hesitations melt away as they begin reading their credit cards to you before you even finish! God-mode guarantees: So good they make anyone say yes (even people who would never normally consider buying). I\u2019ll show you how to stack and layer all four types of guarantees together. I even give you my 13 favorite guarantees word-for-word to swipe for yourself. Magic naming formula to get the absolute highest response rates and conversion rates from everything you do to get new clients And so much more The methods contained within this book are so simple, so instantaneous, and so effective, it\u2019s as if they work by magic. If you implement even one tactic in this book, you\u2019ll see the change in your prospects' demeanor. And you\u2019ll know the $100M Offers method worked when you start hearing, \u201cWhat do I need to do to move forward?\u201d before you even ask for the sale."

    "description": "Companion to the $100M Leads You can get 2x, 10x, or 100x more leads than you currently are withoutchanging anything about what you sell\u2026 This book contains the playbooks that took me from sleeping on my gym floor to owning a portfolio of companies that generate $200,000,000 per year in under a decade. Wanna know the biggest difference between those two time periods? How many leads I was getting. The problem is - most business owners don\u2019t know how to get leads. I wrote this book to solve your LEADS problem. Today, our companies generate 20,000+ new leads per day across sixteen different industries. And, they do it using the eight \u201cnever-go-hungry\u201d playbooks inside. Once you see them, you can\u2019t unsee them. They\u2019re so powerful, they work without your permission. Inside you will find\u2026 \u2026The easiest way to get another five customers tomorrow \u2026The hook-retain-reward system to transforms content into leads \u2026The 6-part ad framework that gets more people - especially strangers - to want what you sell \u2026The one question that immediately turns any stranger (no matter how cold) into a hot lead \u2026The 7 direct referral methods responsible for 30% of my sales \u2026The affiliate playbook that gets hundreds of other businesses to advertise your stuff for free \u2026The agency agreement that gets them to teach you their lead-getting secrets at no cost \u2026The how-to-get-people-off-the-streets-and-getting-you-leads in under 2 weeks framework \u2026and everything else that got our companies boatloads of leads\u2026fast. And the best part is\u2026you can use these playbooks to get more leads within an hour of reading this book. You just have to know where to look\u2026and the first place is inside. If you want to get more leads for your business...then ADD TO CART, use its contents, and see for yourself."

[It's] what the title says: ten minutes a day that connects your talents and abilities to the outcome you're seeking. As a retired NFL player looking forward, I can see as many applications for the toughness Jason Selk's program brought out of me in the business world as there were on the football field.\u201d --Jeff Wilkins, Former NFL Pro Bowl Kicker \u201cThe mental side of the game is extremely important. 10-Minute Toughness helps the players develop the mental toughness needed for success; it really makes a difference.\u201d --Walt Jocketty, General Manager of the 2006 World Champion St. Louis Cardinals \u201cJason Selk has spent a tremendous amount of time and energy developing effective mental-training programs and coaches workshops. He is truly committed to helping individuals and teams to perform at their very best, when it really counts.\u201d --Peter Vidmar, Olympic Gold Medalist Mental training is a must for high performance both on the field and off. But simply hoping for mental toughness isn't going to build any mind muscles. You need a proven routine of daily exercises to get you where you want to go. 10-Minute Toughness is your personal coach for boosting brainpower and achieving a competitive edge in whatever game you play. With quickness and ease, you'll learn how to master your own mind and psych out your opponents using personalized techniques from one of America's most successful sport psychology consultants. Like no other program available, the 10-Minute Toughness (10-MT) routine gets you ready for the competition in just ten minutes a day."

    "description": "#1 New York Times Bestseller 'An enormously smart, clear-eyed, brave-hearted, and quite a personal look at the benefits of meditation' - Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love 'Dan Harris skilfully demystifies meditation, reminding us all that a healthy and happy mind is not only essential for our own sanity, but also for those around us. More importantly, he provides a compelling invitation to move beyond words, from the idea to the experience. A wonderful book and excellent advice.' - Andy Puddicombe, founder of Headspace 10% Happier is a spiritual book written for - and by - someone who would otherwise never read a spiritual book. It is both a deadly serious and seriously funny look at mindfulness and meditation as the next big public health revolution. Dan Harris always believed the restless, relentless, impossible-to-satisfy voice in his head was one of his greatest assets. How else can you climb the ladder in an ultra-competitive field like TV news except through nonstop hand-wringing and hyper vigilance? For a while, his strategy worked. Harris anchored national broadcasts and he covered wars. Then he hit the brakes, and had a full-blown panic attack live on the air. What happened next was completely unforeseen. Through a bizarre series of events - involving a disgraced evangelical pastor, a mysterious self-help guru and a fateful gift from his wife - Harris stumbled upon something that helped him tame the voice in his head: meditation. At first, he was deeply suspicious. He had long associated meditation with bearded swamis and unwashed hippies. But when confronted with mounting scientific evidence that just a few minutes a day can literally rewire the brain for focus, happiness and reduced reactivity, Harris took a deep dive. He spent years mingling with scientists, executives and marines on the front lines of a quiet revolution that has the potential to reshape society. He became a daily meditator, and even found himself on a ten-day, silent meditation retreat, which was simultaneously the best and worst experience he'd ever had. Harris's life was not transformed into a parade of rainbows and unicorns, but he did gain a passion for daily meditation. While the book itself is a narrative account of Dan's conversion amid the harried and decidedly non-Zen world of the newsroom, it concludes with a section for the novice on how to get started."
